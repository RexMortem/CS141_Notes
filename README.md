# Structure of Lecture files

Sometimes Lecture files are split into notes/experimentation I took/did during the lecture, and notes I took from the lecture notes. 

# Repeated Content 

Since these lecture files are made for my own understanding, there may be repetition of concepts as I may write from different perspectives or to refresh myself. As such, there may also be incorrect information within these lecture files as I am learning the content. 

# Reference material 

All of the material that the lecture files are based off is in the functional programming module (CS141) at the University of Warwick. 
These materials are amazing and you probably have access to them if, for some reason, you're reading this.
